# Charlie_Kirk_175_Critical_To_Expose

My name is Bryan Starbuck.  I ask Thomas Massie, who created the Epstein Files Forced Disclosure law... to create a parallel law "Charlie Kirk FILES Forced Disclosure Law".

I have been working on WHAT is critical for that law to require disclosure on. Below is that list that should be covered in that law.


I'm getting out the things that put me at risk.

 I think my life is at risk. Either to be set up to go to the grave early, or legally set up. I will not commit suicide. I also worry I will be taken out in the legal system. ([Here is why I worry](https://github.com/BryanStarbuck/Bryan_Starbuck_Lawfare))




# LAW for CHARLIE KIRK FILE DISCLOSURE
# List to Disclose
## State of Utah v. Tyler Alexander Robinson
## Case No. 251403576 | Fourth Judicial District Court, Utah County
## Judge Derek P. Pullan

Everything in this document is about possible scenarios. The goal of the discovery is
to establish which of these may be a problem.  This document does not make any claim that any
individual or organization did anything criminal, illegal or immoral. Any references
are made for the purpose of discovery towards getting information that will get the truth out
and can help the case of Tyler Robinson be determined NOT guilty.

The goals of discovery are towards establishing one or more of the WHY
which will give the best defense to Tyler Robinson. They can lead to a court finding of
"NOT GUILTY" on most or all of the most important charges. Or to showing reasonable doubt
in the prosecutor's case, leading to not guilty on charges.


WHY #1: If an explosion happened with any mic or electronics on Charlie
    Kirk, that would establish another possible cause of death. It also
    can establish other people involved, even indicating that people with
    power beyond what Tyler Robinson was capable of, were involved. The timing
    matching can also show that they controlled Tyler Robinson, all of the way down
    to the timing. It can also cast doubt that he caused the death of Charlie Kirk.
    It can also possibly show that the FBI is doing a cover-up because this information
    wasn't presented by them from the beginning.


WHY #2: Intelligence Service / Military / Gov were present, involved, knew about it, or possibly assisted.

WHY #3: FBI possibly did a cover-up.

WHY #4: Death was not caused by Tyler Robinson.

WHY #5: The .30-06 rifle couldn't have caused Charlie Kirk's death.

WHY #6: The FBI / DoJ / other possibly carried out obstruction of justice.


Below are "Possible" Linkages. Discovery is to see if evidence can be brought
from government possession into the court case and history books.

(Possible) Linkage #1: Chain of custody for the rifle shows allegedly potential evidence planting. The K-9 unit
    initially failed to find the gun. Then FBI agents arrived and directed a
    "re-search" that suddenly located the weapon. This pattern matches known
    intelligence tradecraft for planting evidence on a patsy. If discovery shows
    gaps in custody, foreign handler DNA, or FBI agents who had access before
    the "discovery," it proves Tyler was framed by sophisticated actors.


(Possible) Linkage #2: The 12 Israeli-registered cellphones at UVU prove foreign intelligence presence.
    NSA reportedly tracked these phones. If discovery confirms Israeli intelligence
    officers were physically present at the assassination scene, it establishes
    that a foreign state actor had operatives in position. Combined with cell
    tower data showing these phones also pinged near Tyler's residence, it proves
    a coordinated foreign intelligence operation, not a lone gunman.


(Possible) Linkage #3: Military planes (SU-BTT, SU-BND, and more) arriving days before the assassination
    with military contractors who stayed in Utah proves foreign government involvement.
    These weren't tourists - they had Defense Attaché badges and received "no-scan
    priority clearance." Discovery of passenger manifests, where they went, and
    whether they visited locations connected to Tyler Robinson would prove state-level
    coordination that Tyler could never have organized himself.


(Possible) Linkage #4: FBI asking witnesses to delete videos is evidence tampering and obstruction.
    Multiple witnesses report FBI agents calling them and requesting they delete
    footage from the event. If discovery confirms this pattern, it proves the FBI
    is actively destroying exculpatory evidence. This suggests the FBI knows the
    official narrative is false and is protecting the actual perpetrators, likely
    foreign intelligence assets the U.S. has relationships with.


(Possible) Linkage #5: The "distraction people" not being charged exposes coordination. Multiple armed
    individuals appeared at UVU that day - PERSON_179_REDACTED with a gun, a pellet
    gun man at Joe Vera's, and others. In any normal investigation, these people
    would be charged. The decision NOT to charge them, combined with blocked FOIAs
    about them, suggests they were assets serving a purpose. Discovery of payments
    to them or communications with intelligence services proves a coordinated operation.


(Possible) Linkage #6: Fort Huachuca meetings September 1-11 could expose pre-planning at the highest
    levels. Fort Huachuca is the Army's intelligence center. If PERSON_10_REDACTED (Kirk's
    security chief) or PERSON_7_REDACTED attended meetings there days before the assassination,
    it raises questions about foreknowledge. U.S. Air Force VIP transport jets (SAM
    callsign) flying between Andrews, Tucson, and Colorado Springs during this window
    could identify which officials were coordinating what.


(Possible) Linkage #7: The surveillance plane N1098L (HADES spy plane) circling 35 minutes before the
    shooting proves advance knowledge and coordination. Someone hired this plane.
    Someone received its surveillance feed. Discovery of who contracted it, who they
    work for, and where the data went would reveal whether U.S. or foreign intelligence
    had real-time eyes on the assassination. A lone gunman doesn't have a spy plane
    providing overwatch - a sophisticated operation does.


(Possible) Linkage #8: Charlie Kirk's texts saying "I know they want me dead" and "they will kill me
    if I break away from being pro-Israel" show he knew who was threatening him.
    He named the threat. If FBI files confirm these communications and show Kirk
    identified specific foreign actors, it proves motive and identity of the actual
    perpetrators. The FBI's failure to present this information from the beginning
    would constitute a Brady violation and evidence of cover-up.


(Possible) Linkage #9: Financial transfers to Tyler Robinson ($50K alleged) and his girlfriend ($20K
    alleged) through DSA-linked accounts prove outside funding. Tyler Robinson
    didn't have the resources to plan and execute this alone. If discovery shows
    wire transfers from foreign sources or intelligence-linked accounts, it proves
    Tyler was a paid asset or patsy. Following the money leads directly to the
    people who actually ordered and financed the assassination.


(Possible) Linkage #10: Electronic jamming of cell/internet signals seconds before the shooting proves
    military-grade operational support. Civilians cannot jam cell towers. Only
    military or intelligence services have this capability. If discovery confirms
    signals were disrupted during the precise window of the shooting, it proves
    a sophisticated actor provided electronic warfare support. This alone eliminates
    the possibility that Tyler Robinson acted alone - he didn't have access to
    military jamming technology.

The first section is on a possible exploding Mic theory

# Exploding Microphone Theory - Discovery Request Items



## FACTUAL CLAIMS TO ESTABLISH

### The DoD Contract
* May 1, 2025: DoD awarded contract N0016425PJ538 for "MINIATURIZED-XS DEMOLITION CHARGES, ANTI PERSONNEL-XS"
* Recipient: Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), McEwen, Tennessee
* Contract value: $440,494
* Delivery deadline: August 25, 2025
* Awarding agency: Department of Defense - Department of the Navy - NSWC Crane
* Only "MINIATURIZED-XS" or "ANTI PERSONNEL-XS" contract ever in USAspending.gov since 2008
* Contract purpose stated as "TO SUPPORT SPM" (meaning unknown)

### The Flight - August 25, 2025
* Private flight departed Heber City, UT to John Tune Airport, Nashville, TN
* John Tune Airport is closest airport to AES facility (~60km)
* Heber City population ~17,000; private flights to Nashville are rare
* No return flight logged
* PERSON_25_REDACTED (brother of pastor PERSON_26_REDACTED) resides in Heber City

### The Manufacturer - AES Capabilities
* AES operated since 1980 (43 years without major incident)
* 1,300-acre facility in McEwen, Tennessee
* ATF, DoD, and DHS compliant; ISO 9001:2015 certified
* Advertised expertise: shaped charge technology, anti-personnel devices (claymore mines), precision explosive pressing (PETN)
* Held security clearances for classified defense work

### The Event - September 10, 2025
* Charlie Kirk killed at Utah Valley University
* PERSON_25_REDACTED present with Kirk before event
* Photos show square object (~2x2") in PERSON_25_REDACTED's front right pocket matching Rode Wireless GO II mic dimensions
* PERSON_25_REDACTED photographed standing with sound crew and person who miked up Kirk
* Post-killing photos show PERSON_25_REDACTED's pocket empty
* Potential involvement of Israeli secret service or Mossad in orchestrating an inside hit, drawing parallels to 2024 pager bombs in Lebanon

### The Microphone Type
* Kirk wearing lavalier microphone (wireless)
* Dimensions match Rode Wireless GO II: 1.8" x 1.8" x 0.7"
* Mic attached via magnetic clasp on shirt
* Microphone identified as tempered glass lavalier style, consistent with glass shards evidence


### Physical Evidence of Explosion (Not Bullet)
* Video shows shirt fabric billowing outward and upward - pressure wave pushing AWAY from body
* Magnetic clasp lifted to ear level
* Blood appears AFTER the blast/pressure wave
* Neck wound appears to be laceration, not ballistic wound
* No exit wound reported
* Vector flow analysis of footage confirms hidden shaped charge in the microphone battery
* Forensic analysis indicated that blood was released from the arterial hit, but the total
  amount was abnormally low. One explanation is a very small-scale explosion occurring close
  to the body, which could cause the heart to stop and limit further bleeding. The blood
  observed appeared consistent with an artery briefly emptying, followed by no continued flow.
   A small-scale explosion could be intended to be quiet, leave no burn marks, produce little
    to no shrapnel, be barely noticeable, and stop the heart to minimize blood loss.


### Fragment Evidence
* Glass/plastic fragments visible in air at moment of impact
* Fragment struck tent roof
* Shards found on Kirk's clothing
* Shards found on ground where Kirk was carried
* Fragments found on SUV floor during hospital transport (Candace Owens photos)
* Kirk's left hand shows cuts consistent with shrapnel (visible in casket photos)
* Video shows low-speed projectile ejecting downward between Kirk's legs at moment of impact


### Crime Scene Alteration
* Crime scene paved over with concrete shortly after incident
* Glass fragments and explosive traces reported on grass before paving

### Factory Destruction - October 10, 2025
* October 3-8: Researcher PERSON_58_REDACTED publicly discussed exploding mic theory online
* October 10: AES factory exploded catastrophically
* 16 people killed
* Deadliest above-ground US industrial accident in 34 years
* All on-site evidence destroyed
